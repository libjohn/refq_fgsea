Using tidyverse principles, demonstrate iteration of *fast gene enrichment* as seen in the {[fgsea](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/fgsea.html)} package.

This annotated reproducible code uses the example data from the {fgsea} ([vignette](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/fgsea/inst/doc/fgsea-tutorial.html)) package after considering a biosquid [fgsea-tutorial](https://biostatsquid.com/fgsea-tutorial-gsea/). The main goal of this code is to share a reproducible example with accessible data. Code for an applied example is also shown. The data for the applied example is **not shown** because I am unaware of the data's provenance.
